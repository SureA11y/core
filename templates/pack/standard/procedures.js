/**
 * How a person assesses each of __TITLE__'s requirements by hand, per
 * version: what proceduresFor gives for a requirement (core's
 * docs/PROCEDURES.md), and the help a manual review or a conformance report
 * reads. Each requirement takes one of three forms:
 *
 * - { wcag: '<criterion>' }: it restates a WCAG criterion, and takes that
 *   criterion's facets and procedures, in every language core has them.
 * - { wcag, replace: { <facet>: { tools, steps, passWhen, failWhen } } }:
 *   it restates a criterion but tests some of its facets its own way. The
 *   facets are core's (src/coverage/wcag-facets.js, or proceduresFor of the
 *   criterion), and a facet named here shows these steps instead of core's
 *   when the requirement is read; read as WCAG, the criterion stays core's.
 * - { facets: [{ id, label, automation, tools, steps, passWhen, failWhen }] }:
 *   a requirement of its own, with the test objectives a person checks.
 *   relatesTo may name the WCAG criteria it relates to without restating
 *   any, which relatedRequirements reads both ways.
 *
 * Steps are short, in English, for someone without accessibility training,
 * from a whole page in a browser; passWhen and failWhen say what they see,
 * and failWhen names the requirement it fails: as written here, or as
 * {{requirement}}, which reads as the standard's name and the requirement
 * ("__TITLE__ 6"), as core's procedures do. tools lists what they need
 * besides a browser: keyboard, pointer, screen-reader, zoom, contrast-theme,
 * devtools.
 *
 * GROUPS puts the requirements of each version in groups, such as themes or
 * chapters, as listProcedures and procedureChecklist show them.
