/**
 * A variant of a core rule: core's contrast-minimum, run at other
 * thresholds. It has no code of its own: the engine runs the core rule's,
 * with `config` as its settings, so a fix to the core rule reaches it.
 * A core rule that can be run this way declares its `settings`
 * (contrast-minimum: normalTextRatio, largeTextRatio, boldLargeMinPx).
 *
 * @check __NAMESPACE__-contrast-enhanced
 * @summary Text reaches a contrast ratio of 7:1 (4.5:1 for large text)
 * @applicability
 *   As core's contrast-minimum: visible text whose colours the engine can
 *   resolve.
 * @expectation
 *   As contrast-minimum, at 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.
